Project Overview
The Library Management System is a Django-based web application for managing books and library users. It includes functionality for adding, updating, deleting, and listing books and users, as well as checking out and checking in books. The project follows a clear object-oriented design by utilizing service classes to handle the business logic.

Project Structure
The project is structured into two main apps: books and users.

books: Contains models, forms, views, and templates related to book management.
users: Contains models, forms, views, and templates related to user management.

We made a robust system where if any user give wrong api then we can handle that situation instaed of printing errors .
We also used class encapsulation method so that no one can modify our .views file and access important information 
we also made our own storage sysytem
